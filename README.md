# A_Bot

A simple web extension to help you mark attendance on canvas from google meet meeting reports

### ðŸš¨ Hold up 

Now i know you are really exited to try this but here are some caveats 

- This extension currently only works on firefox 
- It does not verify files (any .csv file will run )
- It does not check time or date in meeting
- It does not check or maintain state (i.e does not check whether attendance is already marked )
- running the app multiple times will cycle through the canvas attendance state
![its a Feature not a bug](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExY2g5NGRyeDlpczdkaDlnODNocGxsN3RzZnJ4NXVvdzQ1bjBjcnljNCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/gDPxwdP6SKFnsWDJ2u/giphy.gif)

    - e.g
    - Running First time all Names in the csv are marked as present 
    - Running it for the second time they are marked as late 
    - Running it for the third time they are marked as absent
    - Running it for the fourth time will return them to the original state (un-marked)

    ðŸ˜ƒ *told you it was a feature*
